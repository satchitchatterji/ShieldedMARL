## Abstract (Shortened)

This thesis investigates the integration of Probabilistic Logic Shields (PLS) into Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to improve safety, cooperation, and performance in complex environments. PLS offers a human-centric, interpretable framework that allows agents to follow high-level safety constraints while learning. Through a range of experiments in single-agent and multi-agent settings, PLS is shown to enhance cooperation and maintain safety standards across various MARL benchmarks. Despite these promising results, challenges such as computational complexity and scalability persist, paving the way for future research into more robust and efficient shielded MARL systems.

## Background

Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a rapidly growing field, with applications in areas such as autonomous driving, robotics, finance, and healthcare. However, ensuring the safety and cooperation of agents in these high-stakes environments remains a significant challenge.

Probabilistic Logic Shields (PLS) offer a solution by embedding interpretable symbolic rules into RL systems. This project explores the effectiveness of PLS in enhancing safety, cooperation, and overall performance in MARL environments. By leveraging PLS, we introduce symbolic reasoning to MARL, allowing for more controlled and interpretable agent behaviors.

## Research Objective

The primary goal of this project is to extend PLS to multi-agent reinforcement learning environments, enabling agents to interact safely and cooperatively in shared spaces. The key research questions include:

1. How does PLS impact safety and cooperation in MARL?
2. Can PLS enhance performance in both cooperative and competitive multi-agent settings?
3. What are the limitations and challenges of applying PLS in MARL?

## Thesis Contributions

This repository includes:
- The extension of Probabilistic Logic Shields (PLS) to MARL.
- Implementations of various MARL algorithms (PPO and DQN/SARSA based) with and without PLS, on- and off-policy, and shielded and unshielded (vanilla/baseline).
- Experimental results on multiple benchmark environments:
  - **CartSafe (Single-agent)**
  - **Prisoner's Dilemma**
  - **Stag-Hunt Game**
  - **Extended Public Goods Game**
  - **Centipede Game**
  - **Markov Stag-Hunt**

## Experiments

### 1. Single-Agent Experiments
- **CartSafe**: A reinforcement learning environment for safe decision-making.
  
### 2. Two-Player Normal-Form Games
- **Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma**: Investigates how PLS affects cooperation and defection strategies.
- **Stag-Hunt**: Demonstrates how PLS leads to safer cooperative strategies in equilibrium selection.

### 3. Extensive-Form Games
- **Centipede Game**: Explores long-term cooperation and planning between agents.

### 4. Stochastic Games
- **Extended Public Goods Game**: Shows an example of how to incorporate uncertainty estimation in PLS.
- **Markov Stag-Hunt**: Tests the influence of PLS in dynamic, stochastic environments (grid-world).
